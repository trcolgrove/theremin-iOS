### Description:

In an attempt to make the theremin easier to learn and easier to play, we are building an iPad application that mirrors the Theremin while introducing changes that make it easier to play.

### Design:

Similar to a theremin, the instrument is controlled by vertical and horizontal distances from the "faux" instrument. A grid system is utilized in order to make it obvious to the user what note they would be playing at what volume.
